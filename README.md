Selenium Web Automation Project
Overview
This project utilizes Selenium WebDriver to automate web interactions with various web applications. The scripts demonstrate how to perform actions such as logging in, placing orders, and navigating through web pages.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Selenium Library: Install via pip
bash
Copy code
pip install selenium
ChromeDriver: Ensure the ChromeDriver executable is available in your project directory.
Project Structure
The project contains several scripts that perform different automated tasks:

Login Automation Script: This script automates the login process to a web application and checks the validity of the username and password.

Features:
Attempts to log in with various credentials.
Validates success or failure messages displayed on the page.
Tab Navigation Script: This script demonstrates how to open multiple tabs for social media links from a webpage and switch between them.

Features:
Clicks on social media buttons and switches between tabs.
Prints the titles of the tabs to validate successful navigation.
Order Placement Script: This script automates the process of placing an order on a pizza ordering website.

Features:
Fills out a form with customer details.
Selects pizza options and payment type.
Validates success messages and takes a screenshot of the order details.
Usage
To use the scripts, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the required libraries and ChromeDriver installed.
Run each script individually in a Python environment.
Example
Here's how to execute one of the scripts:

bash
Copy code
python login_script.py
Replace login_script.py with the name of the script you wish to run.
